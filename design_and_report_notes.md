In the next paragraph it will be described the design and development of a prototype version of 
a car driver' assistance using ADA Spark. 
The system was developed using the following rules that were provided by the project specification:

2. The car cannot be driven unless there is a minimum charge in the battery.
3. Once in motion, the system will warn of low charge.
4. The speed limit can never be exceeded.
